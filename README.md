# font-randomator-project
A simple app that shows random Google Font fetched from Google Fonts Developer API

Ongoing project to learn JavaScript, Git etc. Feel free to join the project so we can build something cool and learn how to handle merge conflicts :)

All comments and suggestions are welcome!

TODO

- Add a randomize button to change font without page reload
- Add timer so font changes every 3-5 seconds
