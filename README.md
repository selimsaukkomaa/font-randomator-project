# font-randomator-project
A simple app that fetches font array from Google Fonts Developer API and applies it to the page

If you want to run project on your machine please add your personal api-key:

https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api 

Ongoing project to learn JavaScript, Git etc. Feel free to join the project so we can build something cool and learn how to handle merge conflicts :)

All comments and suggestions are welcome!

TODO

- Add a randomize button to change font without page reload
- Add timer so font changes every 3-5 seconds
